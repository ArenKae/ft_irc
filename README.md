## A small Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server made in C++.
Before Discord, Slack, or modern instant messaging, there was IRC â€” one of the earliest ways for people to communicate online in real time. Created in 1988, IRC was a revolutionary protocol that allowed users to join channels, chat with others, and even send private messages across the internet.

At its core, an IRC server acts as the backbone of this communication network. It manages connections, routes messages between users, and ensures that everyone in the right channel receives the right messages. Though IRC may seem outdated, its influence is still visible today in modern chat applications and online communities.

The ft_irc project is a lightweight C++ implementation of an IRC server, built from scratch to better understand how real-time messaging works. It allows us to better understand the concept of sockets that is at the foundation of online communication as we know it today.

## Status
Finished 01/07/2024.

Grade: 100/100

## Usage
### ðŸ’» This program was developed on and for Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS.

Clone this repository and ```cd``` into it. Use ```make``` to compile, then launch the server with :
```
./ircserv <port> <password>
```
### Connecting to the Server Using IRSSI
This project was developed for the [IRSSI](https://irssi.org/) client version 1.2.3. You can install it using :
```
sudo apt install irssi -y
```

After launching ```irssi``` in a separate terminal, run the following command:
```
/connect localhost <server_port> <server_password>
```

You can then join or create a channel to start chatting using :
```
/join <channel_name>
```

To leave the IRSSI client, use ```/quit``` or ```/exit```.

### Connecting to the Server Using NetCat

Alternatively, connect to the server using `nc` or `netcat` :
```
nc -C localhost <server_port>
```

Then, you can input your IRC commands. To properly register on the server, use the following commands in this order:

```
PASS <server_password>
NICK <nickname>
USER <username> <hostname(same as username)> <servername(localhost)> :<realname>
```
